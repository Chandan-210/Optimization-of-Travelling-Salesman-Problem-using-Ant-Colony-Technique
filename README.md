# Optimization-of-Travelling-Salesman-Problem-using-Ant-Colony-Technique
Given a set of cities and distance between every pair of cities, the
problem is to find the shortest possible route that visits every city
exactly once and returns to the starting point. Measure the time
required by Brute Force Strategy and Ant Colony Optimisation to
determine the shortest path possible.
The Travelling Salesman Problem is one of the best known NP-hard
problems, which means that there is no exact algorithm to solve it in
polynomial time. The minimal expected time to obtain optimal
solution is exponential. So, for that reason, we usually use heuristics
to help us to obtain a “good” solution.
